\section{Other controllers}\label{other}

The extension is written for the Mackie Control Universal, but can be used also
with other contollers that support the MIDI protocol of the MCU. For the
Behringer BCF2000 some additional code was added, that e.g. add a workaround 
for the missing touch sensitivity of the faders. This code can be enabled via an
option in the \mcu Control Surface Settings, see \ref{settings}. This option
can be also useful for other controllers. 

The users {\it musicbynumbers} and
{\it nofish} did wrote some instruction for the Behringer BCF2000 and BCR2000:
