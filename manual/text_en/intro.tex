
\section{Introduction}

Welcome to the manual for the \mcu Extension for \reaper (v3.6 or
higher). This extension enhances support for the Mackie Control
Universal (MCU) controller, but can also be used for other controllers
that use the MCU protocol (please read the manual of your
controller to check if and how your controller supports this
protocol). In addition, the extension also supports the Behringer
BCF2000 and BCR2000. tehsux0r has written a setup guide for the
BCF2000 that can be found
\href{http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=117909}{here}
and nofish wrote a setup guide for the BCR2000 that can be found
\href{http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=60110}{here}.

\mcu is released under the GPL 2 licence, for details check
section~\ref{disclaimer}.

\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item \mcu only runs under Microsoft Windows, no OS X version exists
  and none is planned from my side. However, the source code is open to
  everyone and most parts are based on the cross platform library
  JUCE, so if anyone wants to try to port the extension to OS X, this
  should be feasible (and I will try to support them as much as
  possible).

\item The extension does not support the Mackie Control Extender
  (MCE), and  not more then two controllers at the same time in
  general. Also the support of a second controller is already a hack as
  described in section \ref{secondcontroller}.

  If you have a MCE and think it is more important to use the extender
  than the new features in v0.8, you can still download the older v0.6
  from here: \url{http://tinyurl.com/67qjt6y}.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{New in v0.8}

The most important changes in v0.8:
\begin{compactitem}
\item \hyperref[secondcontroller]{2nd controller hack} (since v0.8.3)
\item \hyperref[buttonactions]{Button-emulating actions} (since v0.8.2)
\item \reaper folders can now be reflected on the MCU using the \foldermode
\item \anchors allows locking a \cs to a fixed track
\item \hyperref[fxpresets]{FX presets} (store and recall FX settings) including
a Blind Test feature
\item \hyperref[localmaps]{FX Local maps} (different maps for each FX
instances of the same FX)
\item improved syncing of the MCU state with the \reaper GUI
\item \hyperref[globalactions]{Global Actions} assignments can be named and
shown in MCU display
\item \hyperref[quickjump]{Quick Jumps} added for faster navigation  
\item improved \hyperref[tracknames]{Track Name} handling
\item FX favorites can be stored in \reaper project file
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{Known Issues}
\begin{itemize}
\item On some computers the MCU freezes after  \reaper is started and
  some buttons are pressed. This problem disappears automatically after
  a few minutes or by touching one of the faders several times (until you
  see that the display reacts to the touch, e.g. shows the dB
  value of the track).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mailing List / ``Support''}
You can subscribe at \url{https://www.freelists.org/list/mackie_csurf_klinke}
to a mailing list that will be only used to send notifications about
updates.
To communicate with other users you can use the Reaper Forum,
e.g. via this thread
\url{http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=171827}.
And an issue tracker can be found at \url{https://bitbucket.org/Klinkenstecker/csurf_klinke_mcu/issues?status=new&status=open}.

\subsection{Donations}

Writing the plugin was a lot of work (but also fun most of the time), writing this
manual too (without the fun part). So acknowledgments in the form of donations are
welcome and can be made via PayPal. To donate click
\href{https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=LR54GZHGL6VHA}{here}
or on the Donate button in the Control Surface
Settings dialog. If your DAW does not have an internet connection, you can also
send the donation via PayPal manually to klinkenstecker@gmx.de. But I am also
delighted when I get positive feedback via email or the \reaper forum ;-)
