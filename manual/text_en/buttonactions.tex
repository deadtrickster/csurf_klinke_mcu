\subsection{Button-emulating actions}\label{buttonactions}

The previous section described how \reaper-Actions can be triggered
by the MCU. But it is also possible to use the \reaper-Action
system to  ``trigger'' the buttons of the \mcu. Of course when a
\reaper-Action is used the buttons
are only pressed virtually, but for the \mcu extension this doesn't make
any difference. This feature allows owners of hardware that has not
the same hardware as the Mackie Control to ``extend'' their hardware either
with keys from a computer keyboard or with other MIDI hardware
like the Korg nanoPAD.

How does this work? Figure~\ref{F:Screenshot_Actions_Klinke} shows the
action dialog with the action filter set to ``Klinke''. As you can
see, all actions begin with the String ``Mackie Control Klinke'',
followed by the name of a button of the Mackie Control. The action
descriptions end either with ``(button)'' or ``(key)''. You can assign
these actions as described in section~\ref{globalactions}, the only
difference is, that you don't press a button of the Global View
section on the \mcu, but a button on a different MIDI controller or a
key on your computer keyboard.

So what is the difference between the ``(button)'' and ``(key)''
variants of those actions? As mentioned, an action simulates that
a \mcu buttons is pressed. A \mcu button does also send an event
when a button is released, so this must be simulated also. But
e.g. the release of a computer keyboard key doesn't send any event is
is therefore not recognized by an
action that is assigned to this key. So the ``(key)'' variant
automatically send also the release event directly after the press
event. The ``(button)'' variant waits after the press event till the
action is triggered again and then sends the release event. Most MIDI
controllers sends an event when a button on the controller is released,
in this case they should be assigned to the ``(button)''
variant. Computer keyboard keys and MIDI controller buttons that only send an
event when the button is pressed should be assigned the ``(key)'' variant.

For some buttons like the ``Alt modifier'' only the ``(button)''
variant exists. For those buttons it's important that they are hold
for a given time, so that the ``(key)'' variant is not useful. But you
can also assign keys to the ``(button)'' variant, in this case the
button is virtually hold till you press the key for the second time.
