\subsection{Send-Mode}\label{sendmode}

In the Send-Mode the Channel Strip Section controls the sends of the
selected channel (only the sends of one  channel can be
controlled at one time). You can also press the \send button
twice to show the receives instead of the sends of the selected
tracks.

\begin{itemize}
\item \vpots: Change the send pans (or send volume, see \flip)
\item \solo: Switch the send between mono and stereo
\item \mute: Mute the send
\item \select: Select the corresponding track and show the receives/sends of
the now selected track instead of the sends/receives
\item \faders: Change the send levels (or send pan, see \flip)

\item \mfader: Change the volume of the selected channel

\item \flip: Switch the functionality of the \faders and \vpots
\end{itemize}
