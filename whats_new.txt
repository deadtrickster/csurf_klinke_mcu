1 Known issues 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The extension crashes Reaper when a Project is opened in
  Recovery-Mode. So if you need to do this, first remove the MCU from
  your Control Surface settings, then open the project. Afterwards you
  can enable the MCU again.

  option was used) didn't work
- Changing the MCU Set in the Track settings editor didn't update the
  MCU state immediately
- Store Loop or Time Selection as Regions could crash Reaper4 
- After selecting a FX sometimes the FX selection display still was shown
- Adjust TCP will not touch the track height anymore (i will try to
  improve this later)
