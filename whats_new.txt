Known issues 
---------------
- The extension crashes Reaper when a Project is opened in
  Recovery-Mode. So if you need to do this, first remove the MCU from
  your Control Surface settings, then open the project. Afterwards you
  can enable the MCU again.

v0.8.0.4 
-----------
- Fixed a bug in the Track level meter (which occur with newer Mackie
  Control firmwares).

v0.8.0.3 
-----------
- Fixed a compatibility problem with newer Mackie Control firmwares
  which garbled the display. When closing Reaper, no Reset messages
  are send anymore. So faders and LEDs will stay in their last
  position/status. The credits to this fix goes to zendrum, who
  compared the MIDI output difference of the MCU extension to the
  output of Sonar and isolated the cause.
- Fixed crashes that happened while using Quick Jumps  
- Fixed a display glitch that sometime appear after selecting a new
  Action Mode page
- CONTROL REWIND/FAST FWD jumps always to the project start/end
  (before this didn't work in the Marker Mode of the Transport section) 
- When the folder mode was used, sometimes the screen displayed the
  wrong content

v0.8.0.2 
-----------
- Fixed an incompatibility issue when used via Saitara AC-7 Core
  (iPad/iPhone Software)

v0.8.0.1 
-----------
- Fixed a compatibility problem with other extensions 
- Update of show/hide tracks in mixer (e.g. when the Adjust Mixer
  option was used) didn't work
- Changing the MCU Set in the Track settings editor didn't update the
  MCU state immediately
- Store Loop or Time Selection as Regions could crash Reaper4 
- After selecting a FX sometimes the FX selection display still was shown
- Adjust TCP will not touch the track height anymore (i will try to
  improve this later)
